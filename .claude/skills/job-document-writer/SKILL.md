name: job-document-writer
description: "Generates structured job documents from conversation context for delegation to Worker Agents via the job monitoring system. Use when: a task identified in conversation needs to be implemented by another agent; you need to convert user requirements into a clear, actionable job document; the job should be queued for sequential processing."

# Job Document Writer

## Workflow

Convert conversation context and user requirements into a structured job document, then save it to the `jobs/items/` directory for pickup by the task monitoring system.

### Input

- **Conversation history** - The full discussion between user and AI; read all history but focus especially on the recent conversation
- **Context** - Project context (codebase, architecture, current state)
- **Task intent** - What needs to be done (may be implied from conversation)

## File Generation (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Task Monitor Service Running

**BEFORE creating any job document**, verify that the task monitoring service is running. If the service is not running, the job document will never be processed and will sit idle in the `jobs/items/` directory.

**1.1 Check Service Status**

```bash
# Check if task monitor service is running
job-monitor queue
```

**Expected output if running:**
```
Queue size: 0
Processing: (task name or empty)
```

**Expected output if NOT running:**
```
Error: Task monitor service is not running
```

**1.2 If Service Is Running**

✅ Continue to Step 2.

**1.3 If Service Is NOT Running - STOP**

⚠️ **STOP and ask the user**:

```
⚠️ Task monitor service is not running. The job document will not be processed automatically.

Would you like me to start the task monitor service now? Please confirm, and I will start it before continuing with task creation.
```

- If user confirms → Start the service using `job-monitor start` or appropriate command, then verify it's running
- Only proceed to Step 2 **after** the service is confirmed running

**1.4 Quality Gate**

- **MUST NOT proceed** to Step 2 until the service is confirmed running
- This is a hard stop - no "create anyway" option

---

### Step 2: Investigate & Understand (Before Writing)

Before writing the job document, ensure you fully understand the context and requirements.

**2.1 Analyze Conversation**

Re-read the discussion to identify:
- The original problem/request
- Decisions made during discussion
- Constraints mentioned
- Acceptance criteria discussed
- Any assumptions that need clarification

**2.2 Clarify Task Intent**

Define what needs to be done:
- Specific outcome required
- Boundaries of the task (what's included/excluded)
- Success metrics

**2.3 Investigate Codebase**

Use tools to gather technical context:

```bash
# Find relevant files
glob "**/*.py"           # or appropriate pattern
grep "keyword" --include="*.py"    # search for related code

# Read key files to understand patterns
```

**2.4 Identify Technical Context**

Determine:
- Current architecture/patterns used
- Dependencies and their locations
- Potential edge cases
- Integration points

**2.5 Quality Gate**

Before proceeding to write:
- If anything is unclear → ask questions
- If context is missing → investigate more
- Only write document when you have complete understanding

---

### Step 3: Write Temp File (AI Agent)

Once you fully understand the task, use the Write tool to create the job document with `.md.tmp` extension:

**Temp file pattern**: `jobs/items/job-{description}.md.tmp`

**Example**: `jobs/items/job-fix-auth-timeout.md.tmp`

- Filename WITHOUT timestamp - timestamp will be generated by bash script
- The `.tmp` extension prevents monitor from picking it up prematurely
- Keep description concise and descriptive (use hyphens for multi-word)

**Why `.md.tmp` first?** The job monitor watches for `.md` files only. By writing to `.md.tmp` first, we ensure the document is complete before the monitor sees it. This prevents race conditions where an incomplete file gets executed.

---

### Step 4: Rename with Generated Timestamp (Bash Script)

Run the rename script to atomically rename the temp file:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/job-document-writer/scripts/rename_job.sh /path/to/temp/file.md.tmp
```

**Environment Variables (optional):**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | `/home/admin/workspaces/datachat` | Project root directory |
| `JOBS_DIR` | `${PROJECT_ROOT}/jobs/items` | Job items directory |

**What the script does:**
1. Generates a current timestamp using `date` command (format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
2. Extracts description from temp filename
3. Creates final filename: `job-{timestamp}-{description}.md`
4. Outputs the final file path

**Example transformation:**
```
jobs/items/job-fix-auth-timeout.md.tmp
    ↓
jobs/items/job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout.md
```

**Capture the output** - The script outputs the final file path, which can be captured and passed to Step 5:

```bash
# Capture final file path
FINAL_FILE=$(bash .claude/skills/job-document-writer/scripts/rename_job.sh jobs/items/job-xxx.md.tmp)
```

---

### Step 5: Monitor Status & Verify Results

Track job progress and verify completion using the job-monitor CLI.

```bash
# Poll job status until "completed"
job-monitor job-{timestamp}-{description}

# Status: waiting | processing | completed | not_found
# Poll every 30-60 seconds until "completed"
```

---

#### 5.1 Verify Results (MANDATORY)

**Once `"completed"`, check `jobs/results/` to confirm success:**

```bash
# View results
job-monitor job-{timestamp}-{description}

# Or read JSON directly
cat jobs/results/job-{timestamp}-{description}.json
```

**Check these fields:**

| Field | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| `status` | `"completed"` (not `"failed"`) |
| `error` | `null` |
| `worker_output.summary` | Read what was implemented |

**If failed**: Read `error` field, check summary, create fix job.

**Directory structure:**
```
jobs/
├── items/    # Job documents
├── results/  # ← CHECK HERE for completion details
├── state/    # Queue state
└── logs/     # Execution logs
```

## Full Example

```bash
# Step 1: Verify job monitor service is running
job-monitor queue

# IF RUNNING:
# Output: Service is running, proceed to Step 2

# IF NOT RUNNING:
# ⚠️ Job monitor service is not running. The job document will not be processed automatically.
# Would you like me to start the job monitor service now?
# (After user confirms and service starts)
# Output: Service is running, proceed to Step 2

# Step 2: Investigate and understand (read conversation, explore codebase)

# Step 3: Write temp file using Write tool
# File: jobs/items/job-fix-auth-timeout.md.tmp
# Content: (full job document)

# Step 4: Rename with generated timestamp
FINAL_FILE=$(bash .claude/skills/job-document-writer/scripts/rename_job.sh jobs/items/job-fix-auth-timeout.md.tmp)
# Output: ✅ Job created: jobs/items/job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout.md
#         jobs/items/job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout.md

# Step 5: Monitor and verify results

# Poll until "completed"
job-monitor job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout
# → Status: processing (poll again in 30-60s)

# When "completed", verify results
job-monitor job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout
# → Read summary, check error=null, verify output
# Or: cat jobs/results/job-20260129-170500-fix-auth-timeout.json
```

## Document Structure

Use the template in [references/job-template.md](references/job-template.md) for the document structure.

**Required sections**:
- Task (one-line summary)
- Context (why this job exists)
- Scope (directories, files, dependencies)
- Requirements (specific, actionable)
- Deliverables (what Worker produces)
- Constraints (limitations)
- Success Criteria (how to verify completion)
- Worker Investigation Instructions (explicit research directives)

## Quality Checklist

### Before Job Creation (Steps 1-4)

- [ ] Service running (HARD REQUIREMENT)
- [ ] Job is clear (unambiguous summary)
- [ ] Context provided
- [ ] Scope defined
- [ ] Requirements specific
- [ ] Investigation requested
- [ ] Success criteria exist

### After Job Completes (Step 5)

**Verify results in `jobs/results/`:**

- [ ] Status is `"completed"` (not `"failed"`)
- [ ] Error field is `null`
- [ ] Summary reviewed
- [ ] Artifacts verified

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for good vs bad job document examples.

## Key Principles

1. **Service must be running** - HARD STOP if service not running; ask user to start it before proceeding
2. **Understand first** - Investigate before writing
3. **Be specific** - Vague jobs produce vague results
4. **Request investigation** - Worker Agents must do their own deep research before implementing
5. **Define success** - Worker needs clear completion criteria
6. **Provide context** - Worker should understand why the job exists
7. **Monitor visibility** - Show both waiting and running jobs for complete status
8. **Verify results** - ALWAYS check `jobs/results/` after completion to confirm success and understand what was done
